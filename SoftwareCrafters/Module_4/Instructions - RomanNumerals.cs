                                    Roman Numerals Kata
   
       Write a program to convert Arabic numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents.
       
       The Romans wrote their numbers using combinations of the following letters:
       
       | Number |	Numeral|
       | ------ | -------- |
       | 1      | I        |
       | 5	    | V        |
       | 10     | X        |
       | 50     | L        |
       | 100    | C        |
       | 500    | D        |
       | 1000   | M        |
       
       Initially, the Roman Numerals system consisted of expressing the number in terms of the most appropriate symbol that could be used.
       
       To start, for the numbers 1-4, we would use the 'I' symbol in multiples to represent the number:
       
       | Number |	Numeral|
       | ------ | -------- |
       | 1      | I        |
       | 2      | II       |
       | 3      | III      |
       | 4      | IV       |
       
       When the numbers got to 5, we would use 'V' as this symbol was the most efficient way to represent the number.
       
       | Number |	Numeral|
       | ------ | -------- |
       | 5      | V        |
       
       For the single integers greater than 5, a new rule came into effect: when 'smaller' symbols are appended one or more times behind the 'larger' symbol, it is considered to be added to the value representing the larger symbol.
       
       | Number |	Numeral|
       | ------ | -------- |
       | 6      | VI       |
       | 7      | VII      |
       | 8      | VIII     |
       
       For numbers such as 4 and 9, the smaller symbol (I) is prepended with the larger symbol (V or 5 for the number 4, and X representing 10 for the number 9). When the smaller symbol appears before the larger symbol, it is considered to be subtracted from the larger symbol.
       
       So, 'IV' is evaluated as: V - I = 5 - 1 = 4 and 'IX' is evaluated as: X - I = 10 - 1 = 9
       
       Hence, the list of Roman Numerals for 1 - 9 are as amended to:
       
       | 1 | 2  |	3  | 4  | 5 | 6  | 7   | 8	  | 9  |
       | - | -- | ---  | -- | - | -- | --- | ---- | -- |
       | I | II | III  | IV | V | VI |	VII| VIII | IX |
       
       Because Roman system is follow a decimal notation system, the same rules apply for the next order up: units of 10. In this case, use the symbols, 'X' for 10, 'L' for fifty and 'C' for a hundred.
       
       | 10 | 20 |	30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70  | 80   | 90 |
       | -- | -- | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ---- | -- |
       | X  | XX | XXX | XL | L  | LX | LXX | LXXX | XC |
       
       For the next decimal order up, use the same rules again with 'C' for 100, 'D' for 500 and 'M' for 1000
       
       | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800  | 900 |
       | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
       | C   | CC  | CCC | CD  | D   | DC  | DCC | DCCC | CM  |
       
       (As there are no symbols higher than 'M' (1000) the pattern stops here, and usually Roman Numerals don't consider numbers more than a few thousand)
       
       There were certain rules that the numerals follow which should be observed:
       
       The 'base 1' symbols ('I', 'X', 'C', 'M') can be subtracted from the next highest 'base 5' symbol ('V', 'L', 'D') or 'base 1' symbol, but only one occurrence is allowed. The symbol cannot be prepended to a symbol that is the next decimal order higher. So 'IV', 'IX' is ok' but 'IL' or 'IC' are not. 'XL', 'XC' is valid' but XD and XM are not ('CD' and 'CM' are also valid)
       
       The symbols 'I' and 'X' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row when the symbol is being appended
       
       The 'base 5' symbols 'V', 'L' and 'D' can never be repeated
