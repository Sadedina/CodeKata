        It's a simple problem to understand, but it's oddly difficult to solve.

        The basic premise is really simple.
        You write a class called WordWrap, that has a single static function named
        Wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number.

        The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the 
        right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number.
        You try to break lines at word boundaries where possible.

        ({} -> nil) ________________ no code at all -> code that employs nil
        (nil -> constant)
        (constant -> constant+) ____ a simple constant to a more complex constant
        (constant -> scalar) _______ replacing a constant with a variable or an argument
        (statement -> statements) __ adding more unconditional statements.
        (unconditional -> if) ______ splitting the execution path
        (scalar -> array)
        (array -> container)
        (statement -> recursion)
        (if -> while)
        (expression -> function) ___ replacing an expression with a function or algorithm
        (variable -> assignment) ___ replacing the value of a variable.
