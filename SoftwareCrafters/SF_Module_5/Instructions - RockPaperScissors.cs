    We're going to take the instructions for the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors",
    and pretend it's a customer telling us about the game software they want us to build.  
    We want to try to understand how to "speak the customer's language".


    Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game for two players.
    Each player simultaneously reveals whether they have randomly selected Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    The winner of each round is determined as follows:
        Rock blunts Scissors – Rock wins
        Scissors cuts Paper – Scissors wins
        Paper wraps Stone – Paper wins
        If both players select the same, then that round is a draw.
    The game consists of three rounds, but if there’s no clear winner after three, 
    they continue playing until one of them wins.
